Welcome to my new technical blog!

I've decided to move from a static portfolio to a dynamic blogging platform to share my insights on **AI**, **System Architecture**, and **Wearable Technology**.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:
*   **Java & SciPy**: Deep dives into `jSciPy` and scientific computing on the JVM.
*   **LLMs & RAG**: Practical tutorials on building AI-powered tools like `llm_patent_search`.
*   **Wearable Algorithms**: Techniques for signal processing on resource-constrained devices.

## How This Blog Works

This blog is built with **Jekyll** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**. I'm using **Decap CMS** to write posts seamlessly from the browser, which commits directly to the repository.

Stay tuned for more!

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Code syntax highlighting is working!")
```
