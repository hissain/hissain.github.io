  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="about-text">
    <p>
      I am an accomplished Associate Architect and currently Assistant Principal Engineer at Samsung Electronics, with
      over 14 years of experience in Mobile and Wearables Software Development and Innovation. I have a deep
      understanding of building performant, robust, and maintainable systems - covering requirement analysis,
      architecture, design, implementation, and long-term maintenance.
      <br><br>
      I contributed significantly to Samsung Health for iOS, an app with 6M+ users, 160K+ daily active users, and a
      4.5-star global rating on the App Store. Between 2021 and 2023, I filed seven patent applications through Samsung
      SIPMS, one of which has already been granted in WIPO, US, CN, and KR, while others are under USPTO publication.
      <br><br>
      Currently, I lead the Health Sensing Modalities Team, focusing on pioneering AI-driven health sensing modalities
      and on-device intelligence for wearables. My recent contribution includes developing a stress detection algorithm
      using accelerometer data from Samsung earbuds optimized for RTOS, co-developing the world’s first non-invasive
      wearable sweat sensor for cholesterol and glucose detection in collaboration with Samsung Research America (SRA)
      and Caltech University, and working jointly with SRA and MIT on Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) estimation using
      wearable light sensor data.
      <br><br>
      I have also led the development of on-device part of foundation models for hypertension and premature ventricular
      contraction (PVC) detection from raw PPG sensor data, enabling passive, real-time health monitoring in wearable
      form factors jointly with Samsung Research America, Digital Health Team. My team further conducted an IRB-approved
      clinical study focused on hot flash detection among middle-aged women.
      <br><br>
      My technical expertise covers Digital Health, Android and iOS Mobile app development, Wearables, System Design,
      Application Architecture, Health Sensing Modalities, and Bluetooth and BLE, with additional experience in Tizen
      and Windows app development.
      <br><br>
      My broader interests include AI, Technological Innovation, Human-Machine Interaction, Information Theory,
      Astronomy, the Theory of Relativity, and the Philosophy of Science. I also enjoy playing piano and guitar and
      writing poetry.
      <br><br>
      I value critical thinking, curiosity, and purpose-driven innovation. I believe Software Engineering is not just a
      profession but a way to create meaningful impact - solving real life problems and contributing to human well-being
      through thoughtful technology.
