  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p class="about-text">
    I am an <strong>Associate Architect</strong> and <strong>Assistant Principal Engineer</strong> at Samsung
    Electronics with over 14 years of experience in Mobile and Wearables. I specialize in building robust, performant
    systems and have contributed significantly to <strong>Samsung Health for iOS</strong> (6M+ users). My work
    includes seven patent applications, with one granted.
    <br><br>
    Currently, I lead the Health Sensing Modalities Team, pioneering AI-driven health sensing and on-device
    intelligence.
    Key innovations include stress detection algorithms for earbuds, non-invasive sweat sensors (with Caltech), and
    DLMO estimation (with MIT). I also led the development of on-device foundation models for blood pressure and heart
    health monitoring and conducted clinical studies on women's health.
    <br><br>
    My expertise spans Digital Health, Mobile development, System Design, and BLE. Beyond tech, I am passionate
    about AI, physics, philosophy, and music, viewing software engineering as a means to solve real-world problems
    and improve human well-being.

    <article class="card">
      <h3><a href="https://github.com/hissain/CoronaTracker" target="_blank">CoronaTracker</a></h3>
      <p>A comprehensive, full-stack contact tracing framework designed to combat pandemics like COVID-19. Utilizing a
        privacy-first approach, it leverages multi-modal sensing (Bluetooth, GPS, and NFC) to accurately trace
        close-contact candidates over a configurable period (e.g., 14 days). The system features a scalable backend
        architecture capable of handling nationwide data, aiming to flatten the infection curve while balancing public
        health necessities with individual data privacy.</p>
